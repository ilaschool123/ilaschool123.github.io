        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sam. I am currently an undergraduate at The University of Sydney, Australia. I am still in the process of exploring future career paths; do not yet have a definite destination, but know the right track. I find joy in music and am deeply passionate about scientific topics.

        <h1> Asteroids Project </h1>
        <p>
            I recently worked on an "asteroid project" where I used Python and the Pygame module to replicate the classic Asteroids game. This project involved not only coding but also applying mathematical concepts such as trigonometry to manipulate the angle and speed of the spaceship. <a href="asteroids.html">Click to read more.</a>

        <h1> Calculator Project </h1>
        <p>
            Another project I worked on is a calculator using Pygame. It has two main components: designing the user interface and developing a parser. The parser converts user input from the buttons into a format that the computer can process and compute. <a href="calculator.html">Click to read more.</a>
